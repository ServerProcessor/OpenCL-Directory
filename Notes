1- Compliant software and hardware can provide capabilities beyond those defined in the standard. These additional features are
made available to Open CL applications through extensions.

2- There are two main types of extensions: those that relate to a vendor’s software package (called a platform) and those that 
relate to spe-cific devices.

3- If an extension has been approved by the Open CL working group, its name will take the form cl_khr_<name>

4- If it has been released by a vendor but has not been approved by the working group, the extension’s name will be 
cl_<vendor>_<name>
